# AI-Ally
AI Ally is a personalized virtual assistant Android app developed using Android Studio. It leverages natural language processing to understand user commands and perform a wide range of tasks like sending messages, making calls, opening apps, playing music, and suggesting songs. The assistant learns from user behavior over time, adapting its responses to offer a more intuitive and hands-free digital experience. 
This project includes core Android components such as MainActivity.java, activity_main.xml, and AndroidManifest.xml.
